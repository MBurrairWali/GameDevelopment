## Course Description ##
It's a Course of game development in which we going to develop games by the help of strong game engine Unity 3D


## My Idea! ##
It's true that video games can improve many things like, problem-solving skills, Memorizing vocabulary and etc and best for Brain refreshning, so if i talk about myself as a game developer, I'll create a story based game for example: that game will include some action fight tournament, memorizing vocabulary and some sort of racing games and for girls there must be some stages of cooking foods and cleaning room strategy so its basically a game with many stories and for multiplayers game.
